## Main audio file:
`mag_project.wav`

## Audacity project: 
`mag_project.aup`

No extra tools or effects were used in Audacity.

## Files that I used:
  * `mspaint.wav`: The executable of Microsoft Paint exported as a `.wav` file by audacity
    * `sax.wav`: Output of `timbre_transfer.ipynb` on this file
  * `1.wav`, ..., `10.wav`: Samples generated from `Multitrack MusicVAE.ipynb`
  * `100Hz.wav`, `brownnoise.wav`, `white.wav`: Types of noise
  * `airplane.wav`, `radio.wav`: Sound files
