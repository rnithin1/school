Use same structures over and over again if you plan them out well. Like bench, or chair, or even a room. Make it different by switching out textures. When you design, try to reuse modules. Alcove, ramp, balcony, etc. Can use it in multiple places. 

Unitize as much as possible. Vents have a certain look, you can put them everywhere. Works well in terms of production and rendering the game — can have the same object so it takes less memory to render. 

Funny things with it — for example, basement is the same as above, but everything is a different color. Lighting is powerful so we could have different lighting. 

Easier to give things colors. Thinking about what aesthetic you’re going for is crucial. 

Easiest way to create mood: modify lighting. Flickering

Point light
Light can be key framed (control animations) 
Change intensity 

Graph editor in Maya

To see light: render it out (hardware render) 
Go to render view

Can apply shader to various sides
Lambert shader 

Use of gradient as texture (in hyper shader Maya) 

Uv editor Maya
Unitize in uv editor - each facet has the same texture (looks like a zebra)
