Hi all,

In our final unit for the course (Unit 14), we discuss online learning.

In lectures 25 (April 20) we mostly followed Sections 8.1, 8.2.1, 8.2.2 and 8.2.3 in the MRT textbook. 

In lecture 26 we will discuss the Littlestone dimension and online learning for infinite hypothesis classes. The reading for that lecture is:

Ben-David, S., Pál, D., & Shalev-Shwartz, S. (2009). Agnostic Online Learning. In COLT (Vol. 3, p. 1).

In addition, the following lecture notes are also recommended and cover similar topics:

Lecture notes by Nika Haghtalab: 11, 12, 13, 14
Nika has recently joined the faculty at UC Berkeley - you might want to take her CS294 course next semester :)

Best,

Jonathan
