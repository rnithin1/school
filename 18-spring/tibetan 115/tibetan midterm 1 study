The best way to prepare for this is to read each prompt in relation to the overall work and in relation to the essay with which it was paired. For instance, the stanza about the swan and full moon was considered the day we read the essay by Lauren Hartley, which discusses some of the features of traditional (pre-modern) Tibetan literature. You should also have lectures notes on this verse. Go to the section of the essay that discuses pre-modern literature and look for language you can use to describe the verse (the genre, content, style, etc.). Likewise, drawing upon other readings such as My Tibetan Childhood, try to think of a claim you can make about pre-modern Tibetan society that is relevant to this verse. Do the same for the others. Link up the excerpts from “Waterfall of Youth” with the essay by Tsering Shakya and Circle of White Stones. Likewise for the poem about the show in Bangkok and the reading about Tibetan erotic poery and Tsering Shakya’s article, etc. Remember to account for content, style, and social setting in equal measure. Don’t rush to reduce each snippet of poetry simply to social factors, in other words.
