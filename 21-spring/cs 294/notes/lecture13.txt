Hi all,

In lecture 20 we discussed stability and regularization. The reading material that accompanies that topic is:


Chapter 13 in SSBD. 

I followed the textbook fairly closely, adding in a few definition from the previous chapters. Additional recommended resources on this topic include:


Chapter 14 and Section 4.6 in MRT.

Bousquet, O., & Elisseeff, A. (2002). Stability and generalization. The Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2, 499-526.
