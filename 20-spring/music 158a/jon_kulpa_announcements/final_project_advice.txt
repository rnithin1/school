Narrow your scope.  No need to explore everything.  Trust yourself.

1) what sounds do you like? Then build a final around that exploration.  Mess with inlets to sound-making objects!

    a) samples: go collecting your own at freesound.org and/or https://philharmonia.co.uk/resources/sound-samples/ and/or record your own with your laptop mic!

            - could play with timestretching / transp with groove~, or granular synth with o.granubuf~

    b) synthesis: additive, AM, RM, FM

   c) the real-time real-world: bring it into your patch with a mic and adsr~.  Then use it however you want.

    c) filter anything! (start with a complex sound and remove frequencies with biquad~ and filtergraph~)

    d) effects on your source sounds: delays, downsamp~, degrade~, pitch-stutter~, OSC-yafr2~.  Also, recall any sound can be used to excite a resonator model with resonators~.  If you own VST effects on your computer you can use them in Max with vst~ !

2) what type of control and timing?  Each of the following is its own world of expertise.

   a) a precise composition: hit bang and everything runs.  If you demand precision and precise synchrony between multiple voices and parameters,  this is perhaps the hardest model to accomplish in Max.  Think step-sequencer, automated lookups, and envelopes with function table (fed to line~ or curve~).  If you need to map an itable or multislider list to a scale of choice, you'll want steps-to-scale~.  Do your best to control time given the tools you were shown.  If you try really hard and end up with something that is not exactly what you wanted, its ok!   I am also here to help you.  

   b) perform it...map many musical parameters to various controllers.   QuNeo, mouse, and/or qwerty keyboard...see the scale() function in odot to map input values to output values you want to hear.

   c) random selection of values including durations of time (ranAB, ranIJ), random metros

   d) when one process ends, detect it (e.g. the 2nd outlet of line~ or of groove~), and use that bang to start a new process

   e) other automation (LFO, rand~...odot code running the show)

3) how dense, how many layers?

   a) hey, at least a duet.  =-)

   b) many layers of activity?  (could be randomly floating in and out of scene, or can try to control, again see above)

   c) poly~, abstractions

4) Basically that's it, but think like a composer: go in with a plan to create change over time.  This sound will go to those sounds.  These inlet values will migrate to those inlet values.  The plan may change as you explore.

5) Delight in the "unicorns" that will emerge from your exploration, emergent sounds and design.  I know you are trying to finish a project, but maybe even...ENJOY IT!  =-)
