plot(dts, type = "o", main = "Simulated ARIMA(1,1,0) Datasets", ylab = "Data")
#Note that this dataset has 101 points. 
#In general, arima.sim generates datasets of length n + d
# Note that this process isn't stationary! But it's first difference will be. 

#ARIMA(0,1,1)

#Recall that the estimate of mu is given by the "intercept".
#The mean of the differenced series is assumed to be zero while using arima with d > 1. 
#If you need to fit a non-zero mean ARMA model to the differenced data, 
#use ARMA on the differenced series, or a different function (coming at later in the script)

### Second example: co2 dataset. Taken from the book by Cryer and Chan.

data(co2, package = "TSA")
help(co2, package = "TSA")
#There is a different dataset with the name co2 in the package datasets.

plot(co2, xlab = "year", ylab = "CO2 Levels", main = "monthly Carbon Dioxide Levels at Alert, NWT, Canada", type = "o")

#Both Trend and Seasonality:
#Seasonal difference:
t1 = diff(co2, 12)
plot(t1, main = "Seasonal Difference of co2")
#First difference of t1:
t2 = diff(t1)
plot(t2, main = "Seasonal and First Difference of co2") 
#No trend or seasonality now. We can now fit a stationary model. 

acf2(t2)
#Large negative autocorrelation at lag 1 and then a bunch of small autocorrelations 
#followed by large autocorrelations at lags 11, 12, 13 (the one at lag 12 is quite large)
#PACF Not very interpretable, perhaps lags 1, 2, 11, and 12? 

# READ aloud in class: To fit a good model for this dataset, we need to learn about seasonal and multiplicative seasonal ARMA models.

#Seasonal ARMA and ARIMA models:
par(mfrow=c(2,1))

#Seasonal MA(1) model
th = c(rep(0, 11), 0.7)#theta = 0.7
L = 100

corrs = ARMAacf(ma = th, lag.max = L)
par.corrs = ARMAacf(ma = th, lag.max = L, pacf = T)
plot(x = 0:L, y = corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)
plot(x = 1:L, y = par.corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Partial Autocorrelation")

#Seasonal MA(2) model
th = c(rep(0, 11), 0.7, rep(0, 11), 0.8)
L = 100
corrs = ARMAacf(ma = th, lag.max = L)
par.corrs = ARMAacf(ma = th, lag.max = L, pacf = T)
plot(x = 0:L, y = corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)
plot(x = 1:L, y = par.corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Partial Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)


#Seasonal AR(1) model
ph = c(rep(0, 11), 0.7)#phi = 0.7
L = 150
corrs = ARMAacf(ar = ph, lag.max = L)
par.corrs = ARMAacf(ar = ph, lag.max = L, pacf = T)
plot(x = 0:L, y = corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)
plot(x = 1:L, y = par.corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Partial Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)

#Seasonal AR(2) model
ph = c(rep(0, 11), 1.5, rep(0, 11), -0.75)
L = 150
corrs = ARMAacf(ar = ph, lag.max = L)
par.corrs = ARMAacf(ar = ph, lag.max = L, pacf = T)
plot(x = 0:L, y = corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)
plot(x = 1:L, y = par.corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Partial Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)

#Seasonal ARMA(1,1) model
ph = c(rep(0, 11), 0.5)#phi = 0.4
th = c(rep(0, 11), 0.8) #th = 0.8
L = 150
corrs = ARMAacf(ar = ph, ma = th, lag.max = L)
par.corrs = ARMAacf(ar = ph, ma = th, lag.max = L, pacf = T)
plot(x = 0:L, y = corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)
plot(x = 1:L, y = par.corrs, type = "h", xlab = "Lag k", ylab = "Partial Autocorrelation")
abline(h = 0)

#Therefore the acf and pacf of seasonal ARMA models look just like those of usual ARMA models at the seasonal lags.

#Prediction
m = 24
fcast = predict(m1.co2, n.ahead = m, interval = 'predict')

### fcast$se is the best way to use the forecast() function to get at an interval. The specifying the interval 
### option is not available for arima() models like it is for lm() models.
