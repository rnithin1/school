You know groove~ transposes by sending it a desired playback speed (1. = untransposed).

At office hours, some students wanted to know if they could have fine control over transposing a sample (by a number of halfsteps up or down.   To send groove~ the correct playback speed that corresponds to a desired number of halfsteps up or down, it is an exponential function:

       speed = 2^(n/12)

            where n is the number of halfsteps, e.g. n =  -2 is two halfsteps down.

Here is a patch that implements this for you:
