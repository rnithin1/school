Hi all,

In the next two lectures we will discuss boosting.

I recommend skimming through Sections 10.1, 10.2 and 10.3 in the SSBD book, which cover the basic idea of Boosting.

Additional recommended reading:

Chapter 7 in: Mohri, Rostamizadeh & Talwalkar (2018). Foundations of Machine Learning.
Book: Schapire & Freund (2013). Boosting: Foundations and algorithms.
Best,

Jonathan
